Other Enhancements: Reorganized files for easier usability. Implemented a photo slideshow with HTML, CSS, and JS instead of displaying all the photos at once on the same page.
This improves the usability of my about me page and displays the photos in a better way in my opinion. It is also better because I can display more photos and not clog up the webpage.
Building off this I could implement a automatic slideshow that switches photos every couple seconds with a timer implemented in JS.
